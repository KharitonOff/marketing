Getting ready to Contribute
---------------------------

You need to install ruby >1.9.3 and clone the repository. Open a terminal and
`cd` into the repository directory. (if you have osx or linux you should
already have that, on windows I recommend this http://rubyinstaller.org/)

Install all necessary ruby libraries:

	bundle install

Once that's done, you are ready to contribute.

You can add/edit the files and compile it and start a small http server to look
at it in your browser with `rake serve`.

> this automaticatlly compiles all files when you make changes, so no need to
> restart the server

You can publish the site with `rake publish`.
